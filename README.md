# Nefarious LinkedIn 

LinkedIn has been caught using dark patterns in the past. However, there's a dark
pattern being used by LinkedIn today no one talks about. LinkedIn currently spies
on their own users. In particular, LinkedIn wants to know which browser extensions
you use and may even ban your account for using them.

I'll dive into how LinkedIn detects extensions, and which extensions they are 
currently targetting. I have even built a simple browser extension to expose 
which extensions LinkedIn is scanning you for as well!
